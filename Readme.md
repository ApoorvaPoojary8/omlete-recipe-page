# 🧑‍🍳 Frontend Mentor - Recipe Page Solution

This is my solution for the [Frontend Mentor Recipe Page Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). 
I built a responsive recipe page using just HTML and CSS. It showcases a simple omelette recipe with prep time, ingredients, instructions, and nutritional details.
